    <h1>Rachel Ferguson's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Rachel Ferguson, and I’m a second-year neurotypical Studio Arts and Media Studies student with a passion for creative design and digital media. I am seeking internship opportunities to build my skills and gain experience in the field of Emerging Media. My career path is settled in visual arts and creative design, I always had a deep infatuation within digital media. My favorite form of media art is animation, specifically stop motion animation. Stop motion animation always brings excitement to me because of how you can animate an inanimate object, motioning it from one frame at a time. Stop motion/ motion graphics as work of media helps me build up my creativity, giving me an opportunity in learning the medium hands-on.</p><p>As a beginner animator, I am curious in wanting to learn the complex and professional side of animation. Taking MEDPL 150 can give me the opportunity to develop skills necessary for my career path. Despite that I have no experience in media arts, I learned by watching online video courses. I also like to draw and sculpture as a form of meditation from becoming overwhelmed. Before college, I attended extracurricular visual arts programs, building my artwork from scratch learning more hands-on projects. My favorite project was a sun mask that I sculptured during my last year of high school. I enjoy creating art as a form of self-expression and escapism, allowing myself to express my creativity abilities without feeling pressured. I want my work to reflect the theme of self-growth and creative freedom. I have little experience when using other editing software apps, but I am determined to learn more skills in helping me succeed in the future.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>When I first saw the instructions for the first assignment, I felt a little confused and nervous. I was having a feeling of anxiety due to the many steps and specific codes I had to type in making my own site. I felt like if a mistake happens, the whole thing will become lost. The assignment also made me frustrated with the repetitiveness of making the same html due to it not having a save as button. It caused me to take a break and find a way to keep it without the page reloading and disappearing. However when I got used to the process, I started to feel less anxious and more confident. I learned that if I made a mistake it can help me understand that it is a part of self-improvement. Doing something for the first time repetitively can help with mental memorization. As a beginner learning web development, it became easier when I went to HTMLDOG.com and understood every step and the definition of each code when making a html document. The experience of making the document made me feel more motivated and determined in learning more skills in MEDPL 150. During this course, I’m hoping to learn and gain basic and complex software skills such as all the Adobe apps and other software websites in editing my own portfolio. I am mostly hoping to gain software editing skills and coding that can help me with media software art such as illustration and graphic design.</p>
