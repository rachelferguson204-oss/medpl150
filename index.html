    <h1>Rachel Ferguson's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Rachel Ferguson, and I’m a second-year neurotypical Studio Arts and Media Studies student with a passion for creative design and digital media. I am seeking internship opportunities to build my skills and gain experience in the field of Emerging Media. My career path is settled in visual arts and creative design, I always had a deep infatuation within digital media. My favorite form of media art is animation, specifically stop motion animation. Stop motion animation always brings excitement to me because of how you can animate an inanimate object, motioning it from one frame at a time. Stop motion/ motion graphics as work of media helps me build up my creativity, giving me an opportunity in learning the medium hands-on.</p><p>As a beginner animator, I am curious in wanting to learn the complex and professional side of animation. Taking MEDPL 150 can give me the opportunity to develop skills necessary for my career path. Despite that I have no experience in media arts, I learned by watching online video courses. I also like to draw and sculpture as a form of meditation from becoming overwhelmed. Before college, I attended extracurricular visual arts programs, building my artwork from scratch learning more hands-on projects. My favorite project was a sun mask that I sculptured during my last year of high school. I enjoy creating art as a form of self-expression and escapism, allowing myself to express my creativity abilities without feeling pressured. I want my work to reflect the theme of self-growth and creative freedom. I have little experience when using other editing software apps, but I am determined to learn more skills in helping me succeed in the future.</p>
