         <h1>Reading 1: In Plato's Cave Reflection</h1>
         <p>After reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” (1977), the article helped me comprehend the deep connections between a person and the camera. In understanding photography and image making collectively, my relationship with it would be perceived as a new art technique that is surprisingly beneficial. Photography or taking photos means that I can learn the many different angles in different directions like how one sketches a perspective view. Photographs are like one huge memory file, where I view everything around me but in digital form. When taking photographs, it makes me understand the different techniques specifically on a mobile phone such as altering the hue, saturation, and contrast. This technique reminds me of the color theory like a photograph; the saturation and contract of a drawing or painting can be altered into a new perspective. A perspective that can be beneficial when working a job in the field of media. In connection to photography, image making plays a role by altering the photo from its dull reality to a unique and more meaningful image. For me, image making is like telling a story but through artistic expression, especially when making graphics from it. Despite having little experience with photography, it helps me capture moments that not even the average person can capture. In comparing an artist like me to image making is the attention to intricate details. When images are being made, many photographers, animators, and graphic designers would use photography and images in marketing a movie, company, or their artistry, which is a goal that I am determined to pursue.</p><p>When it comes to image making and photography from a career perspective, it plays a role in hands-on experience, strategic experimentation, and detail-orientation. Both forms of digital prototype help bring a sense of perseverance, creativity, and calmness to my approach. These digital techniques to me as an entry-level/beginner animator such as cropping, masking, and color saturation can help me gain skills in storytelling my work. Learning image making hands-on can help me with memorizing my ability in storytelling, in critique how I can form the image and create graphics for realistic effect in my artistic approach in the present.</p><p>Ever since photography and image making was invented, it significantly helped shape the world’s perspective and interaction with digital cameras or regular cameras in the present. From what I see from a cultural perspective, both photography and image making helped people share their cultural experiences where it creates more social interaction. Whereas other aspects of creative art such as illustration combined with photography on an emotional level can bring out a feeling or meaning behind it, expressing intense or subtle emotions to the viewer. In addition, the current times even use photography as a tool of social networking. Social media bloggers use to take photos and create images in connecting other communities of interest, building a bigger community. Despite my response being complex, Sontag’s view helped me understand the simplicity, but deeper meaning behind the works of photography in the present.</p>
